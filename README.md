# Dum Sim Music Mixer (Hong Kong Style!)

This is a project that we want to create a themed music mixer animation about our hometown - Hong Kong. It is a food music mixer, and shows case that a local HongKonger, holding a dim sum container. With javascript interaction, there are 10 dim sum allowed to drag and drop on the person, then local music will be played.

The music mixer contains a large background image(the local HongKonger) for dropping totally 10 icons onto the guy and the he will play the HK music. User could choose those 10 icons which are svg images of 10 different dim sum foods represented HK. (Trying to do the icons are covered by a bamboo cover, the dishes will be revealed when user's mouse hit the icons.)


HTML, CSS and Javascript are expected to be used in term of the interaction with users who will interact with these icons, and play with them, drag and drop for playing some Chinese instrument music.

This is the first time for us to create a website related to Javascript.

We have no relevant experience in creating interactive websites. 

Although it is a bit challenging for us, but still a GOOD experience for us!
